The 'Hello_World' project is a simple program for the MAX32630 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX32620 EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - SYSCLK = 96.00 MHz

 - The message "Hello World!" is displayed on the Evaluation Kit OLED and 
   transmitted via the UART on connector CN1 to a host terminal at 115,200 Baud, 8N1. 
 

The HelloWorld example program is available in two different targets:

  MAX32630 Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the Hello_World program.
