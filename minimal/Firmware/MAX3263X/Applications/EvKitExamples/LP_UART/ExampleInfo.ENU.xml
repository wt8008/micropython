  <iar_description>
    This example wakes up and receives data from a transmitter. Connect
    the TX of the transmitter (P2.1) to RX (P2.0) of the receiver. Connect
    CTS of the transmitter (P2.2) to RTS (P2.3) of the receiver. The debugger
    has the potential to reset the receiver as it's transitioning from LP1 to
    LP3 so it's best to disconnect the debugger after programming. Once both
    devices are programmed, reset the transmitter, reset the receiver, press
    push button 0 (PB0), labeled SW1, on the receiver, and press PB0/SW1 on the transmitter to start the test. To use this application, two evaluation kits are required, or it's possible to configure any transmitter to the same UART settings and send a wake up character.
