The 'ADC' project is a simple program for the MAX32630 and MAX32621
microcontroller using the Maxim Integrated 'MAXX3262X EV KIT' Evaluation
Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS
v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - ADC Measurement

 - Display output on the LCD

 = Measurement results via Serial
 
The ADC Demo is available in a Flash Debug target.

  MAX3263X Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)

Jumper Configuration:
  No jumper configuration is required for the ADC Demo program.
